**In this repository, you will find the basics that every enthusiastic programmer needs to enter the amazing world of Machine Learning!**

**I will apply in all the development the most popular automatic differentiation libraries Pytorch and Tensorflow and of course, I will work in the most important programming language in ML Python, which is the base of these amazing libraries.**

**Enjoy!ï»¿**
